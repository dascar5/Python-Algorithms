# Python-Algorithms

Some algorithms including lists, inputs, loops, etc. Did this for a mate at uni, might be useful to you too. The assignments are:

1) Write a function that expands a string with a given prefix, sufix, and n - number of times prefix and sufix multiply
2) Write a function that only returns the count of elements of a list that are less than the given max
3) Given 2 list inputs, find the elements that appear in both
4) Write a function that has a list as input, and have it return a sublist with the longest increasing chain of positive numbers in a row
5) Return the count of hex numbers in a given string (hex starts with 0x)
6) Check how many times an input substring appears in an input string
7) Check how many words ends with input character in an input string, count and print them
8) Write a function that returns only the given number of characters from the start of input string and adds ... at the end
9) Split an input string based on an input number of characters (space counts as a character too)
10) Write a function that squares all the elements of an array in between 2 input numbers that are divisible by 3, but not by 6, including them, and then sums all the squares
11) Given a,b,i, return the list and sum of elements between a,b that are divisible by i, including a,b
12) Write a function that sums squares of all the odd elements in between a given start and an end
